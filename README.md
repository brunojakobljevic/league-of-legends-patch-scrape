# leagueOfLegendsPatchScrape
A script which finds most changed champions, items and spells in League of Legends.
It iterates through "https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/" for every patch avaliable and finds the name of every object they have changed.
Then it counts how many times the said object has been altered, and displays the objects with the most frequent changes(the 3 largest numbers, so if 'N' items share a place with the same 'M' number of changes, they will all be displayed)
