A script which finds most altered champions, items and spells in League of Legends.

It iterates through "https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/" for every patch avaliable and finds the name of every changed, removed or updated object.

Then it counts how many times the said object has been altered, and displays the objects with the most frequent changes(top 3 largest numbers, so if 'N' items share a place in the top 3 with the same 'M' number of changes, they will all be displayed)
